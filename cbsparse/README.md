# Sparse ML

Libraries and utilities for applying sparsification recipes to neural networks with a few lines of code, enabling faster and smaller models.

## Optimizers

Currently supporting the following sparse optimizers:

- [Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04316-3)
- [Rigging the Lottery (RigL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11134)

## Utilities

Currently we have utilities for supporting:

- FLOP counting and tracking
- Adding different sparsity inducing regularizations to your training run
